# Tenera Coding Challenge

## Introduction

This repository contains a simple Java backend service providing a set of API in order to obtain weather data from https://openweathermap.org/api.

## Run Application

Download repository or 	``` git@github.com:jeredom/tenera-challenge.git ``` to your desired location. Import the application to your IDE and run it.

The application runs on ``` localhost:8080 ```.

## Documentation

A Swagger OpenAPI documentation can be found [here](http://localhost:8080/tenera-challenge-docs.html)

## Testing

API and service unit tests can be run depending on your IDE settings. They can be found under the path src/test/java.

## Deployment

I have not personally deployed an application using Terraform and AWS. This is all being handled by our CTO. I can, however, provide links to the tutorials I have
read and found most fitting. I would use these tutorials if I had to follow this process for the first time by myself.
